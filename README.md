# Koha
[![Discord Chat](https://api.travis-ci.com/ppy/osu-web.svg?branch=master)](https://discord.com)

Koha is a land filled with light waves from all over the galaxy living in harmony with sound waves. The creator, Katsuniya, created an endpoint for people around the world to explore Koha for all the treasures it has to offer.

Once you enter Koha, you have a choice. You either become a light wave or a sound wave. Light waves have a number of sub classes and so do sound waves with extra activities to offer.

Your task, once you've gained your side, is to solve mysteries, explore worlds, do tasks and most importantly, finish the story mode. 

Koins can be collected from all the things you do, both bug and small. These koins can be used to buy numerous materials including, but not limited to, extra life, weaponary, books of life, blood of the gods and much much more.

So what are you waiting for. Join us in our beta program as we try to create discord's most advanced open world game. 

NB: We're also making a light novel to help you understand the game better and why different elements are located, so make sure to check the light novel out. When uploaded, the link will be posted here. You can read it on our website ot the webnovel website.

# Development
Currently on Phase 1 - Stage 2, we've made the basic components of the game such as help commands, fun commands, profile command and alot more hidden stuff.

What we plan to make currently include:

- Finishing the start command so users can join our database
- Allowing players to farm Koha and unlock "Hidden places"
- Find special missions

And much much more.
